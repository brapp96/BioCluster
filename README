BioCluster, a toolkit for managing biological data and graph clustering


Contains several graph clustering algorithms and data sets. GUI should be pretty
intuitive to use, just choose an algorithm and a dataset and hit cluster.

If you want to use your own datasets, they need to be in the following adjacency
list format:
<node> <nodes connected to it numbered greater than it> (for each node in graph)
[<labels>] (in csv format)

So the graph with the adjacency matrix [1 1 0;0 1 0;0 0 1] and label vector 
[1, 1, 2] would be represented as follows:

0 1
1
2
[1, 1, 2]

Check the examples folder for more complex examples.

Requires MATLAB to run. 

Instructions:
Start MATLAB and run design_gui.
